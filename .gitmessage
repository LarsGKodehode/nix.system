# Commit message conventions

## Formatting rules

- **Subject length**: Limited to 50 characters
- **Casing**: Use lowercase, except for proper nouns
- **Mood**: Use imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature")
- **Conciseness**: Be concise. The diff already shows what changed and where. Focus on why or provide context.
- **Review staging**: Always review the staging area and base the message on the content there.
- **Body formatting**: Split bodies into paragraphs and use bullet points where sensible.
